This project aims to introduce the basics of game development using the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) or the MiniLibX library. The main objective is to create a simple 2D game where a player can move around a map, collect items, and reach an exit to win. This project helps students understand graphics rendering, event handling, and game mechanics.
